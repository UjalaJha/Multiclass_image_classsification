# Multiclass_image_classsification
The aim of this project is to process
pictures of one piece of garbage and classify it into 5 categories consisting of glass,
paper, metal, plastic, and cardboard. We have additionally produced a dataset that
contains around 400-500 pictures for every category, that was each hand collected
and gathered from online sources . A convolutional neural network is employed
during this project, created on Googleâ€™s open source code library for dataflow pro-
gramming - Tensorflow. This project additionally uses Transfer Learning to use
already existing predicting models of image classification and rewire them for finishing the task at hand
